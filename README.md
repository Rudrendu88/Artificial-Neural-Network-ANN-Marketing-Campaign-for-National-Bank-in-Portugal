# Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-for Marketing-Campaign-for-National-Bank-in-Portugal

Data: 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The data consists of 41,000+ rows of data with 21 attributes (Qualitative and Quantitative).  

Conclusions: The Artificial Neural Metwork (ANN) trained on 80% of the data set gave an accuracy of 88% on the test data (which was 20% of randomly selected data from the main dataset).
