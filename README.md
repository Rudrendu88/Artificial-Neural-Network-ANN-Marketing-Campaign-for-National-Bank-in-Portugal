Data:

Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
 
The data consists of 41,000+ rows of data with 21 attributes (Qualitative and Quantitative).  
 
Conclusions: 
 
The data set was split into a 80-20 ratio for training and test data sets respectively. The ANN model was then trainied on the training data set.

The The Artificial Neural Metwork (ANN) model had an accuracy of 88% on the test dataset.
